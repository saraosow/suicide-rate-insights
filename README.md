This is a short project & presentation that I created for a Python Methodologies MBS course.

In the future, I would update this further to...
- Find percentage of deaths/population size for different demographics. For example, (# of deaths of men in the US aged 15-24)/(# of total men in the US aged 15-24) in a given year.
- Compare this to pandemic-era data? Find a dataset with information regarding suicides during 2020 and onwards to see if any ages/countries vary greatly. Would countries with stricter isolation policies show greater rates of suicides?
- Compare this to prison/crime data? How is this data affected by the amount of crime, the laws, etc. in a country?
